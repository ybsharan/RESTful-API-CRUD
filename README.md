### APIs Built Using Nodejs and ExpressJS

This project is a collection of APIs built using Nodejs, JavaScript, ExpressJS, and Postman. The APIs are all RESTful and support the four main HTTP methods: **GET**, **PUT**, **POST**, and **DELETE**. The APIs are designed to be easy to use and can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as **creating**, **reading**, **updating**, and **deleting data**.

Here are some of the benefits of using Nodejs, JavaScript, ExpressJS, and Postman to build APIs:

* Nodejs is a fast and scalable platform for building web applications.
* JavaScript is a popular and well-supported language for web development.
* ExpressJS is a powerful web framework for Nodejs.
* Postman is a popular API testing tool.
